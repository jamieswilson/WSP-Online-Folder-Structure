<h2 id="intent">Site Intent</h2>
<p>The intent of this project is a re-design of Christ Episcopal Church’s website.  
The re-design will include enhanced site structure using validated HTML and CSS standards, 
responsive design, and improved aesthetics.  A new logo will be designed as the current 
logo is displayed in plain text.  Navigation will be completely redone because the 
current configuration is not organized and does not convey a clean look.  </p>
<p>There are no connections to social media of any kind on the current site.  Additionally, 
the site does not currently display well on mobile devices.  Both of these issues will be
 addressed in the re-design.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Competitive Analysis</h2>

<p>As this site is affiliated with a religious organization, its only competition is 
other Episcopal Churches, all of which are non-profit.  An inspection of the competitor’s 
sites showed a clean, polished and organized look with a smooth web 2.0 feel.  All 
competitors had links to social media sites on their home pages and intuitive navigation 
controls.  Additionally, graphics and photos were higher quality and higher 
resolution.  </p>

<p>A local (Florida) Google search query found the site within the top 10 results (#9).</p>  

<h2 id="audience">Targeted Audience</h2>

<p>The targeted audience for Christ Episcopal Church (using info gathered from similar 
sites as no data was available for the specific site) is Caucasian males and females age 
50 and older, in the United States.  They have high levels of education and generally 
earn 100k or more per year.  They are also, obviously, affiliated with religious 
organizations, specifically, Episcopalian.  Users typically spend very short amounts 
of time on the pages of the site. </p>
