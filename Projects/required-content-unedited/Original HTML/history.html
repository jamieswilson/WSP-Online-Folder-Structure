    <td width="50%"><font face="Maiandra GD">On November 1st, 1903, All Saint's Church was started in the University District of
      Seattle, Washington. Because there was already an Episcopal Church with
      the name &quot;All Saint's&quot; in the Seattle area, the name of the
      church was changed in its early years to Christ Episcopal Church.&nbsp; A
      Chapel was built on the corner of NE 47th Street and Brooklyn Avenue NE in
      1904, and the first church was built on that site in 1909.&nbsp;</font> </td>

      church was built on the corner lot.&nbsp;</font> </td>

    <td width="50%"><font face="Maiandra GD">In 1931 the parish hall was moved to 12th NE and given to the
      YMCA for use as a gymnasium.&nbsp;The church itself was moved to the south lot, and
      the corner lot was leased to Shell oil for a gas station.&nbsp;</font></td>

      Nov. 21. This structure,
      erected on the corner lot, was to be used for offices, Sunday School
      classes and meeting rooms. Plans had been made to rebuild the church as
      well, but these were later abandoned, or at least put on indefinite hold,
      and the church building was bricked.</font></td>
