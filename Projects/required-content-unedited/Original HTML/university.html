<p><font size="6" color="#660066" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Christ Episcopal Church &amp; The
University of Washington</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">"In the beginning" the church's formation was on a small scale,
inspired by the desire of a few neighbors to establish an Episcopal church in
the developing residential district near the university, an area called Brooklyn
at the time. <b>Dean Milnor Roberts</b> of the College of Mines at the UW was a
founding member.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Travel between Seattle and Brooklyn was by boat or railroad until David Denny
built the Latona Bridge in 1891.&nbsp; This hand-operated drawbridge carried
horse-drawn traffic and streetcar tracks which extended north. The university
moved from downtown Seattle in 1895 and the streetcar station nearest to the
campus was called "University Station" at 42nd &amp; 14th (now
University Way).&nbsp; The 1900 census listed about 400 people in the Brooklyn
Addition.&nbsp; Among them were the founding families of Christ Church.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Col. J. N. Gilmer and family moved to E 45th &amp; 15th NE in March
1903.&nbsp; The family found it difficult to attend the nearest Episcopal
church, so with neighbors they founded "the mission at University
Station,"&nbsp; named All Saints.&nbsp; The name was later changed to
Christ Church to avoid confusion with another All Saints parish in the
diocese.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

The Rev. Paul Boynton James was rector from 1922-1942.&nbsp; He was also
appointed student chaplain at the university in 1922.&nbsp; His scholarship
attracted professors from the UW including <b>Prof. William Wilson</b> and <b>Dr.
Frederick Padelford</b>, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. During the
Depression, the parish hall was donated to the YMCA for a gymnasium and moved to
12th NE. The church was moved to the next lot south and the corner was leased to
Shell Oil for a gas station to help stabilize church income. However, lean times
and disaffection with Boynton's high church orientation reduced membership and
finances to a critical level.</font> </p>
