<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span LANG="EN">Dear SHARE
Indoor Shelter Hosts:<br>
<br>
Today the SHARE Power Lunch/Board of Directors overwhelmingly voted to re-open
the SHARE Indoor Shelter Network Tomorrow (Sunday Night!)<br>
<br>
At 7:00 AM tomorrow the SHARE Downtown Encampment - located on the North Plaza
of the King County Administration building on 4th Avenue &amp; Jefferson - will
be dismantled.&nbsp; Important elements of it - 175 mats, approximately 400
blankets, &amp; etc - will begin the trip back to the indoor shelters.<br>
<br>
SHARE's fleet of (well used) cars and vans will spend Sunday moving things from
the Plaza to Indoor Shelter sites, with stops at the Aloha for blanket washing
when possible.<br>
<br>
<b>The reopening of the indoor shelters was made possible because of the action
of two groups:&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
1)&nbsp; The King County Council on Monday unanimously passed an Emergency
Ordinance which authorized $250,000 of reduced rate tickets to be released to
Human Service Agencies for use in 2012.<br>
<br>
2)&nbsp; The King County Community Services Department codified and created a
RFP (Request for Proposal) Process to disburse these tickets, which could result
in their being released by November 12, 2012.<br>
<br>
We are deeply disappointed that the King County Executive - Dow Constantine -
has not publicly acknowledged that the actions of the County Council and his own
Community Services Department make it possible for SHARE's need for bus tickets
and the Council's Concerns for fairness to both be successfully met.&nbsp; At
the same time, we appreciate his not arresting us for encamping on the King
County Administration Building Plaza, and for visiting S/W's Tent City4
yesterday.<br>
<br>
Leadership publicly stating their priorities is always important.&nbsp; SHARE
recalls Mary's Place - an outstanding Homeless Womens Center - persuading the
Seattle City Council to allocate funding for a Family and Women's Shelter last
fall, but a month later the proposal and Mary's Places' participation in were
sabotaged by Seattle's Human Services Department.&nbsp; Lack of leadership by
County Executive Constantine leaves open the same possibility for SHARE - we
still hope that County Executive Constantine will publicly address this.<br>
<br>
SHARE intends to keep the pressure on County Executive Constantine through the
OCCUPY CEHKC effort. Ironically County Executive Constantine is also Co-Chair of
the Committee to End Homelessness, which SHARE, Real Change, WHEEL and
Nickelsville have been pushing to exercise leadership on behalf of more shelter
and encampments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us know if you are interested in further
information about Occupy CEHKC:&nbsp; A community wide effort is taking place
this Tuesday and Wednesday, and your participation would be welcomed.&nbsp; Call
us if interested, or go to the Facebook Public Event Site:&nbsp; &quot;Without
Shelter People Die&quot;<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
<br>
The SHARE Bs Tx Crisis Central Committee<br>
