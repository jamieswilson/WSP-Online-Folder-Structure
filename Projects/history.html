		<h2>Our History, A Church On The Move</h2>
		<p>
	On November 1st, 1903, All Saint's Church was started in the University District of 
	Seattle, Washington. Because there was already an Episcopal Church with the name 
	"All Saint's" in the Seattle area, the name of the church was changed in its early 
	years to Christ Episcopal Church.  A Chapel was built on the corner of NE 47th Street 
	and Brooklyn Avenue NE in 1906, and the first church was built on that site in 1909.  
	In 1914 this structure was moved to the lot south of the corner lot, and it was 
	remodeled to serve as a parish hall. A new church was built on the corner lot. In 1931 
	the parish hall was moved to 12th NE and given to the YMCA for use as a gymnasium. 
	The church itself was moved to the south lot, and the corner lot was leased to Shell 
	oil for a gas station.  In 1954 the new church house was dedicated on Nov. 21. This 
	structure, erected on the corner lot, was to be used for offices, Sunday School classes 
	and meeting rooms. Plans had been made to rebuild the church as well, but these were 
	later abandoned, or at least put on indefinite hold, and the church building was bricked.
